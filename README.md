PHP bindings for https://github.com/bitcoin/secp256k1

# About
This extension is a work-in-progress! Please create an issue or PR 
if you might be able to help, as currently some things aren't 100%. 
  
  - Currently has all functions from secp256k1 besides two - secp256k1_ec_sign_compact() and secp256k1_ec_recover_compact(). They will follow shortly. 
  - Positive tests are present for all currently added functions. The C library also has it's own tests, with some useful edge case tests, which will be ported soon. 
  - It has mainly been tested on PHP5.6.
